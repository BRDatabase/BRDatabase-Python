1970/71 SERVICES#def#When the new time table comes into operation on 4th May, the London Midland Region promises faster trains, regular interval services and new coaches for Anglo-Scottish expresses.[br]Between Euston and Glasgow an average reduction of forty-five minutes on present timings will be achieved, whilst between Birmingham and Glasgow the up journey will be cut by sixty-five minutes and the down journey by fifty-five minutes. Fifty minutes will be cut from the fastest Liverpool/Manchester and Glasgow train timings. Brand new coaches will be provided and the motive power over the non-electrified sections of the main line will be two Class 50 diesel locomotives operating in multiple. Those noted so far with m.u. control include [416/29/37/8].[br]The London-Glasgow service will be im proved and comprise five trains daily in each direction at two-hourly intervals. The 22.50 Euston-Perth sleeping car train will be with drawn and also the overnight train between Liverpool/Manchester and Glasgow. Trains to Scotland from Liverpool! will operate from Liverpool Lime Street instead of Exchange. Blackpool-Euston services have been revised and will operate from the North station in stead of the South, as will most of the services to Manchester.[br]It is intended that Sunday evening services will also be accelerated and track maintenance work will be revised accordingly. Cross country services through Birmingham have been retimed to give improved connections and Lancashire to West of England trains will in future travel via Birmingham.

CREWE#On 9th November, 1969, the Works contained the following: Paint shop: 386, 1664/93, E3192, E6017. Test roads: 288, 319/25, 1505/13, 1808/69/70/85, 8308. Electric fraction shop: 283, E3049/63/80/4, E3125/38/ 42/54/5/69/88, E6018, E26006/12/27. Traction motor shop: 1572. Erecting shop: 352/94, 400/30/5, 1511/5/6/8/59/70/83, 1638/60, 1702 marked “conv. to 1908”, 1729/30/3/49/56/7, 1839/79/95/8, 1901/2/57/87, 5156, 5203. 8064, 8197/9, 8310. Erecting Shop Yard: 1754, 1889. Sidings (Arrivals): 1703/5, 1849, 1962, E3132/66 (Departures): 1617, E3020. E6032 was in the siding opposite the station awaiting Works on this date.


ST. PANCRAS#1st November found St. Pancras with the unusual sight of three Class 47’s in the terminus at 18.00. The first to appear was 1548 (41A) which found itself incorrectly at the head of the 17.50 to Sheffield. At the same time Class 45 72 was at the far end of Platform 5 bearing headcode 1E16 for its rostered duty to Sheffield. 72 was then attached to the 17.55 Nottingham and headcode amended to 1D38 (on the previous two Saturdays 1601 (87A) and 1608 (82A) have taken this train). With 1548 removed to out side the terminus 1853 (D05) appeared to head the Sheffield train on Platform 7, still bearing headcode 1D38. Five minutes before booked departure this was corrected. Mean while Class 45 75 with headcode 5V21 had arrived in platform 6 with the e.c.s. for the 18.00 return excursion to Sheffield, to be headed by 1548 with headcode 1M21. All was now ready for the prompt departure of the 17.50, 17.55 and 18.00, but for one thing, only the 17.55’s crew were present and its departure was only three minutes late. The cause of all the trouble was the 14.10 (1M28) Sheffield to St. Pancras which arrived fifty four minutes late at 17.57 with 143 piloting 1628, the booked locomotive for the 17.55 and crew for the 17.50 (the 18.00 crew were also passengers on this train). The 17.50 departed only 15 minutes late with the 18.00 immediately after. 1628 had failed near Wellingborough with a burst radiator.

MILL HILL#The final demolition of Mill Hill signal box commenced on 25th October, a lot of the wood recovered being carried across the slow lines and thrown into the gap between the line and the adjacent motorway on to a vacant plot below. By the following Monday destruction was complete and most of the wood removed.

NARBOROUGH#This station, closed in March 1968, is to be reopened (for a period of three years) on 4th January, with an initial service of eight trains daily (four each way). The reopening is a triumph for Blaby Rural Council who have waged a long battle with British Rail over this issue.[br]
For the first year the Council expect that the station will cost them £15,000, and in the next two years £16,000-£17,000 if the reopening is justified.

NOTTINGHAM#Due to the installation of power signalling Nottingham station was closed from 22.00 6th December to 05.00 8th December (except for the 21.06 Sunday Nottingham-Derby and 19.15 and 20.00 Sunday Nottingham-London). All main line trains were diverted via Derby. Express buses were run between Nottingham and Derby to connect with trains to and from the North, Birmingham and the South-West, Stoke-on-Trent and Crewe. Passengers for London travelled by bus between Nottingham and Loughborough. The local Nottingham Derby local service was replaced by buses calling at Long Eaton and Beeston. Local trains between Nottingham and Leicester operated as far as Loughborough with a connecting bus service to and from Beeston and Nottingham. Local trains between Nottingham and Lincoln, and Nottingham and Grantham operated from Carlton and Nether field and Netherfield and Colwick respectively with a bus service to and from Nottingham station.

STOP

RUGBY-LEICESTER G.C#On 3rd November, T. W. Ward, contractors, commenced lifting the track from the Rugby end. On closure in May a road for the use of M.6 motorway construction vehicles near Whetstone effectively cut the line. To enable the lifting train to run from Lenton, near Nottingham, through to Rugby required the reinstatement of the track across this road. Motive power is usually a Class 25, 7618 being noted on 16th November. By the end of November about three miles of track had been lifted. The lifted rails are cut into short lengths and at the end of the day the entire train is taken back to Lenton materials yard for storing the track there.

WILLESDEN. - S.R. electro - diesels E6039/45 were recently observed at the Electric Depot, after working a cement train to Willesden where they handed over to E3130.

BLETCHLEY#3797 and 1731 were the only locomotives stabled at the station on 16th November, and 12046 was the only withdrawn locomotive waiting disposal at the depot. Two shunting turns at Bedford have recently been transferred to this depot from Crickle wood: 3850 and 4135 have accordingly joined the Bletchley fleet. The duty at Ayles bury has ceased and shunter 3795 sent to Derby Works some months ago has not been seen here since.

NORTHAMPTON#On 20th November Class 33/2 6548 (70D) was in the down sidings having brought in an oil train from Fawley. Other members of this class have been seen at Bletchley and Northampton, from which it would appear that there is a regular daily working of a Class 33 from Fawley to Northampton and back.

BIRMINGHAM#The removal of track and demolition of buildings continues apace at Snow Hill. Rubble is being dumped on the former through lines and practically blocked up the tunnel entrance: this led to letters in the press, since the tunnel is to form part of the projected “rapid transit’’ system. However, an official assurance followed, that the dump ing was only a temporary measure and the entire tunnel would eventually be cleared. For anyone with a leaning towards nostalgia the posters are wonderful: one can see the progress of B.R. modernisation and the visitor is informed that the L.M.R. electrification, Manchester - Liverpool - Crewe - Birmingham - London is making good progress. B.R. provides a service to industry with a picture of two freight trains; one powered by a Class 40 diesel and the other by a Cl. 9F steam. How ever, if the traveller wants to know the time of train departures he is unfortunate, all that is available being the somewhat tattered remains of the 1968/69 departures, both for Snow Hill and New Street. The entrance to the station, dingy as it is, is further depressed with the remains of posters announcing proposals to close, or the actual closure, of most of the local lines in the West Midlands. It is small wonder that B.R. can say that a taxi would convey the number of passengers on some trains. On Monday, 22nd September, the 17.38 to Langley Green left with four passengers.

With reference to the note on p. 370 November 1969 R.O., the 18.00 New Street Cambridge reported as two Cambridge two car sets is actually booked to be so. The frequent appearance of a Class 31 and the coaches is presumably due to shortage of d.m.u’s. The inwards working of this service is 13.00 ex-Cambridge.

There have been a number of developments recently which might have interesting effects on the railways in the area. Residents on the “‘overspill’’ housing estate at Chelmsley Wood, near Coleshill, with an eye to future transport requirements have launched a survey of the prospects of a loop line from Marston Green through Chelmsley Wood to the Nuneaton-Birmingham line near Water Orton, to provide a circular rail service. Residents of another housing area near Water Orton are also campaigning for a halt to be provided between Water Orton and Castle Bromwich. Even more significant is the pressure from the local authorities concerned for the reopening of the Rugeley-Walsall line, which closed in 1965. This would also involve the Walsall Wolverhampton line, since the service envisaged is Wolverhampton to Rugeley via Walsall. In this connection it is of interest to note that on 22nd November local trains in and out of New St. were packed, passengers standing two deep in some cases, as the result of a 24-hour Corporation bus strike.

NUNEATON#Regarding the notes on p. 370 November 1969 R.O., the normal week day “‘allocation’’ for local work is as follows :- two Class 47 and three Class 25 of Birmingham Division (Class 25’s air-braked) and two Class 47 and one Class 25 of Nottingham Division. The Class 08 working is a special arrangement provided by Saltley as required and therefore any of the Saltley non-air-braked 08’s is likely to appear.

A 0-4-0WT The King, built Edward Burrows (37 of 1906) which formerly worked at U.G.B. Charlton, has arrived at Market Bosworth. The locomotive has latterly been stored at Robertsbridge and its appearance on the L.N.W.R./Midland Joint line is connected with a proposal by the Midland Railway Society to take over and operate part, at least, of the Joint Line between Nuneaton and Moira, whose closure by B.R. seems imminent.

WALSALL#Further Class 31’s have been noted working through on the 07.40 Ely-Kidderminster sugar beet train instead of coming off at Leicester. Examples noted included 5524 on 22nd October, 5572 on 30th October, 5633 on 7th November and 5637 on 20th November, all seen at Walsall where this train changes enginemen. Class 31’s have now become everyday sights at Walsall on the various steel trains from the north and north-east to the West Midlands.

Unusual Eastern Region visitors to Walsall included Class 37’s 6835 on 30th October and 6827 (S1L) on a Consett-Wednesbury special freight on 15th November. A Western Region example of this class, 6879 was noted on 8M34 on 22nd October. Another rare visitor was Class 47 1578 (64B) on a northbound train of empty steel-carrying wagons on 8th November.

The once extensive railway system covering the Cannock Chase coalfield has virtually vanished. The only lines still used are the lines from Ryecroft Junction, Nr. Walsall to Rugeley which deals with traffic from West Cannock and Lea Hall collieries, and from Hednesford to Cannock Wood colliery, which is worked by N.C.B. engines from the colliery to B.R. at Hednesford. These are the only collieries still working. The line from Anglesea sidings through Chasetown and Chase Terrace to Coopers Lodge Jct. where it met the Hednesford-Cannock Wood line, has been disused for many years and most of the track lifted, although an original Cannock Chase and Wolverhampton signal still stands in situ at Anglesea and is the only sign that a railway ever existed there. Also gone is the line from Norton Jct. on the Walsall-Lichfield line to Fast Cannock Jct. just south of Hednesford, which was known as the Norton branch. Most of this has now been lifted, together with its various sub-branches to the now defunct collieries, with the remaining sections still remaining to be lifted in the near future.

WOLVERHAMPTON#On 11th November E6102 was noted passing High Level in a down freight at 18.40. Track recovery is proceeding at Low Level. Both the former up and down main lines terminate in the sta tion and no physical connection now exists to the north.

BESCOT#8572 was still in the holding sidings, whilst 5908 was at the depot together with 3538 on 23rd November.

RUGELEY#Merry-go-round coal trains to the power station recently observed on the main line south of Crewe have been double headed by Class 47’s. If, as it seems, this is the regular arrangement, it is an innovation as far as this line is concerned.

WELLINGTON#The lines still open for traffic in this area, apart from the former G.W.R. main line, are Wellington (Stafford Jct.) to Donnington on the Shropshire Union line, and Madeley Jct. to Buildwas.

The Donnington line serves Granville Colliery, C.O.D. Donnington and Sankey’s Works at Hadley. Granville Colliery is about two miles south of Donnington, and the col liery branch is now worked by two N.C.B. diesel locomotives which recently replaced three steam locomotives. Most of the output from the colliery is sent to the Ironbridge power stations at Buildwas, about 15 miles by rail from Donnington. Two trains a day are now operated, and to reach Buildwas these have to reverse at Wellington and also at Madeley Jct., the locomotives running round the trains at both places. The new Ironbridge ‘‘B’’ power station is now partly in operation and is served by “‘merry-go-round”’ trains. To deal with the additional trains, which will increase to ten per day including some from the Stoke area, a new siding giving a run round clear of the main line has been laid at Madeley Jct.

The line from Donnington to Newport closed completely on 24th September 1968, but at least one track is still in position.

Another closed line which still has the track in position, at least at the Wellington end, is the Wellington (Market Drayton Jct.) Nantwich line, which closed completely on 1st May 1967. A weak overbridge about 13 miles north of Wellington has supports placed between the up metals which would prevent the line being used in an emergency.

The former L.N.W. branch from Hadley Jct. to Coalport East has been lifted throughout. The bridge over the Wellington to Newport road has been removed and a about mile of the trackbed south of the road is now used as an access road to a new housing estate. At the other end of the line, Coalport station has been completely demolished. A sewer for Telford New Town is being laid along the course of the line from Coalport to just south of Madeley Market station, and a concrete footpath is being laid over the sewer. The rail way bridge over the B4380 road just north of Madeley Market station has been removed and replaced by a concrete footbridge, and a wide concrete footpath has replaced the track from just south of the station, which is still standing and occupied. The footpath is to be extended over the trackbed through the new town area towards Oakengates.

The short branch from the Donnington line at Trench, which served several works on the south side of the Wellington to Newport road, has been disused for several years, but the track is still in position although much overgrown and the lines have been tarred over at the road crossing. There was a small sub-shed of Shrewsbury at Trench Crossing, which closed in 1948, and the last locomotive there was L.M.S. 16027, a C.R. 0-4-0ST which was then kept at Wellington.

The former G.W.R. Wellington to Much Wenlock line from Ketley Jct. to Lightmoor Jct., which closed on 6th July 1964, has been lifted as far as Horsehay, but the track appears to remain in position between Horsehay and Lightmoor Jct.

GARSTON FREIGHTLINER TERMINAL#The handling capacity of this terminal has been more than doubled by the provision of two huge electric mobile straddle cranes spanning six rail tracks, two roadways and two lines of the container storage area. A vast concrete parking ground for road vehicles, improved office accommodation and staff amenities have also been provided. The terminal was opened in 1966 and demand has steadily increased.

MANCHESTER AREA#On 14th October, Class 25 7585 was noted on the Stockport Buxton line on an officers’ special with saloon 99503, still painted maroon. On the 15th Class 40 369 was noted travelling up to Buxton with M50483 and a goods brake, and returned to Longsight hauling Class 25 5273 dead. The Merthyr-Manchester mystery tour (1Z61) was noted on 22nd November passing Cheadle Hulme behind Class 47 1598. The General Manager visited Buxton on 19th November,
travelling on the L.N.W. route from Stockport in saloon 45000 propelled by Class 47 1721.

The signal boxes at Peak Forest North and Chinley Station South have both been demolished. The line between Cheadle Heath and Chorlton Junction was closed on 17th August. Passenger services between York and Manchester via the Calder Valley cease from 5th January, and passengers will have to travel via Leeds.

Although Sunday services between Sheffield and Manchester via Woodhead are scheduled for electric haulage in the working timetable, diesels were noted in use on 23rd November. Class 40 234 Accra headed the 11.40 ex-Manchester and 14.30 back, and Class 47 1768 the 12.40 ex-Manchester. Passenger services on this route cease on 5th January.

BOLTON#All that remained of the locomotive shed on 29th November were the derelict offices, the rest having been demolished.

SOUTHPORT#As part of B.R.’s selective pricing policy off-peak return fares in the Borough of Southport were reduced to below the return bus fare from 30th November,
from 2/3d. to 1/7d. from Ainsdale (bus fare 1/8d.) and from 1/6d. to 1/3d. (bus fare 1/2d.), but it is difficult to see that a variance of id. will make much difference.

SETTLE AND CARLISLE#A 22/6d. Skipton-Appleby day return provides a reasonably inexpensive two-and-a-half hours travel through some of the most impressive scenery in England. On 15th November, a day of wind and rain south of Hellifield, driving sleet in Ribblesdale and a moderate snowstorm beyond Blea Moor, Class 45 129 on the eight-coach 10.20 Leeds-Glasgow and Class 46 189 with eleven coaches on the up “Thames-Clyde Express”’ both kept easily to time.

At Skipton the shed still stood, although only a shell with all windows broken. The turntable pit was full of water and the tracks had been removed. There were still sidings on the east side of the line, where Class 24 5112 stood on an up freight. Gargrave station and box were open, but there are now no sidings. At Bell Busk station, closed in 1959, the buildings were in good repair and used as a private house, but although the box was open the plat form and sidings were removed several years ago. Hellifield station looked as inhospitable as ever and the shed was still boarded up, as it had bzen when full of engines awaiting a more permanent home. Although there are some sidings still used for wagon storage and the down loop contained a freight, there seemed a considerable area of unused and unsaleable railway land. Long Preston box and station were open, and there were sidings containing wagons on the west side at Settle Jct. The box controlling the junction with the Carnforth line was open, but there were no platforms although the station building still stood.

Settle was the only place of activity on the line. The station was well kept, the box open and the sidings contained several wagons being loaded. The quarries at Stainforth hav2 been disused for years, and the line to the quarry at Helwith Bridge seemed derelict. The box was closed and had its nameboards removed.

The station, box and quarry siding at Horton in-Ribblesdale were in use, and Selside box was open. Salt Lake cottages, the only trace remaining of one of the shanty towns which sprung up near Ribblehead when the railway was built, still stood and some at least seemed occupied. Ribblehead station is still open but the box was shut. Blea Moor box was in use,
although sadly in need of a coat of paint, and the houses behind have not been occupied for a few years. Two Class 25’s were in the down loop while the 10.20 Leeds-Glasgow passed.

Dent Head box is scheduled for early demolition, and has not been used for a considerable time, although at Dent both the box and the station were open. The snow fences on the hillside were in need of repair,
although some of the posts still standing were providing a few sheep with a windbreak. The troughs at Garsdale have been taken up,
but both box and station are open and there are a few sidings on the west side. The signal box at Ais Gill was open, but Mallerstang box looked very decrepit. Kirkby Stephen station and box are open, and there are some sidings remaining. Crossing Smardale viaduct the trackbed of the N.E.R. Eden Valley Jct. Barnard Castle route, closed in 1962, could still be distinguished. Crosby Garrett station was Closed in 1952 and the buildings no longer stand, although the site is still obvious. Griseburn box was standing, but the platform at Ormside, also closed in 1952, has been taken up. The N.E.R. line at Appleby East is still open between Appleby and a short distance beyond Kirkby Stephen East for quarry traffic.

KINGMOOR#A short stretch of the spur connecting the up and down goods lines with the Waverley route has been lifted together with redundant pointwork at the Kingmoor end. This spur which was about a quarter-of-a mile long was built and opened in 1963 with the marshalling yard to act as a second exit and entry for south and northbound freights respectively. It was taken out of use during July 1969 with the final closing of Canal Junction box.

REGION#WESTERN REGION


CORNWALL#The following were noted at Cornish depots in November: St. Blazey: 3526, 4008/9, 6312/8/22 and 868/70 on the 9th. Par: 4007, 6309/23 on the 9th. Truro: There were two cross country units, 51575/84, 59581 and 51578/87, 59580 on the 10th. Penzance: 820/4/34, 1036/41 and 6307 on the 10th. 4013 was station pilot. The St. Ives branch unit was 51313/28, 51403. No Class 52’s are diagrammed for St. Blazey but a Class 47 from the freightliner is spare at St. Austell during the morning for permanent way work.

WEST OF ENGLAND#Punctuality. A record was created on 5th November when the “Devonian’’ arrived at Paignton on time, the first occasion that this has been achieved since 5th May! Since then three further on time arrivals have been recorded. However, black spots still occur and lateness at Newton Abbot have been fifty-three, thirty-one, forty-six, forty-two and sixty-one minutes on 28th and 31st October and 4th, 17th and 24th November respectively. On 4th November a special d.m.u. was put on in the train’s times from Bristol, on the other dates a special was laid on from Newton Abbot to Paignton except the 17th, when it was impracticable. From 3rd November Class 46 142 was ex changed at Bristol for 146, which gave way to 154 (green livery) a few days later. On 25th November the up train was seen double headed by 816 Eclipse piloting 154 and the return proved to be another green member of the class, 138. The Class 46 is not used on Saturdays and lays over the week-end at Newton Abbot shed.

NEWTON ABBOT#The 14.30 Padding ton-Penzance (1C60) is usually a good time keeper, except when held to connect with the late running ““Devonian’”’ (1V80). However, on 3rd, 6th and 18th November this train was twenty, eighteen and forty-four minutes late respectively. On the middle occasion the train had somehow dropped no less than twelve minutes between Dawlish and Newton Abbot. On 30th October the 11.30 Paddington Paignton was 111 minutes late at Dawlish due to being re-routed via Bradford-on-Avon, Bath and Bristol because of a defective rail between Westbury and Taunton. The train only just reached Paignton in time to take up its booked return working at 17.00. This train was again in trouble on 11th November due to a locomotive failure at Exeter. It was passed there by the 08.50 Liverpool-Plymouth (1V73). Because of the late running of the 13.37 Sheffield-Plymouth on the same day, the 16.30 Paddington-Penzance made a special stop at Dawlish as it had previously done under similar circumstances on 28th October. On the following day it was the turn of the “up traffic’. The 17.55 Penzance-Manchester was running sixty minutes late in Cornwall and a special train was put on from Plymouth to Bristol in its times. The day after it was the turn of the down line and the 08.50 Liverpool Plymouth (1V73) was eighty-four minutes late. The 12.30 Paddington-Penzance (1C55) made special stops at Dawlish and Teignmouth to provide the west-bound service. On 17th November an up train failed between Plymouth and Newton Abbot, believed to be the 13.15 from Penzance-Paddington. As a result the locomotive rostered to work the special to Paignton in lieu of the late running “Devonian” referred to above, had to go to the rescue and the special was cancelled. The resulting delay to up traffic was such that the 16.25 Plymouth Exeter was twenty-five minutes late. To add to this the 12.15 Newcastle-Plymouth was sixty nine minutes late.

EXETER#On 1st November Class 22 6330 was noted here reinstated to traffic. On 24th November the 23.45 Paddington-Penzance was running fifty-five minutes late and a special train was run from here to Plymouth in its times.

The “Golden Hind” 07.05 Plymouth Paddington (1A17) was heavily delayed on 25th November. It was stopped near Rattery, whilst the line was searched. The locomotive then found that it was unable to raise a vacuum and assistance was required. The outcome was a departure from Newton Abbot eighty-four minutes late, preceded by the 08.30 Paignton-Paddington. The ‘Golden Hind’ set was unable to reach London in time to take up its booked return working, the 11.30 Paddington to Paignton. The return locomotive working is the 13.30 Paddington Paignton, which arrived in the West Country behind 1017 Western Warrior. It is believed that this was not the locomotive that worked the up “Golden Hind”’ into Paddington.

BRISTOL#On 22nd November a three car non-vestibuled d.m.u. passed through Keynsham at speed, roughly in the path of the 06.15 from Paddington. There were few passengers on board and the destination blind showed Langley Green.

The Minister has given approval for the closure of St. Annes Park and Saltford stations with a reduced service at Keynsham and Oldfield Park.

SOUTH WALES#Formerly stored Class 14’s 9500 and 9517 have been brought back into service at Cardiff Canton and used for shunting duties and have also been pressed into service on permanent way trains. 9521/4 36/8/55 remain in store at Landore.

On 14th November the 08.10 Bristol Swansea was strengthened by two suburban three-car units. The 20.05 Swansea-Fishguard consisted of two-car and three-car cross country units and one of the suburban units. The eight-car set returned to Swansea on the 08.00 service on 15th November. This was probably the first time a suburban unit has reached Fishguard. This strengthening was caused by the Swansea v. South Africa rugby match. The units eventually returned to Cardiff on 15th November.

From 19th November the units used on the Bridgend-Cymmer Afan service return to Cardiff (Canton) each night instead of stabling at Cymmer. This is for winter frost precaution. The units leave Canton at 05.00 and return at 22.15. On Saturdays only a single unit is used strengthened when necessary.

The liner train workings from Fishguard have not yet materialised. The following working, however, was introduced on 22nd October and is diagrammed for Class 47 haulage :-

07.00 Danygraig-Fishguard. TThSO.

12.45 Fishguard-Danygraig. TThSO.

12.45 Fishguard-Cardiff (Canton). SO.

Since 5th October Class 37’s have taken over the Albion-Waterston oil trains and are fuelled by Gulf at Waterston and Albion. They are given weekly maintenance at Canton.

The trains involved are below :-

00.52 Waterston-Albion

12.32 Albion-Waterston 09.55 Waterston-Albion

02.20 Albion-Waterston 15.10 Waterston-Albion

07.15 Albion-Waterston.

On 23rd November 6888/6979 and 6943/97 were stabled in pairs at Llanelli.

The Carmarthen pilot duty has been reduced to one Class 08 and the Class 03 pilot at Fishguard has been replaced by a Class 08. Another Class 08 is kept as spare for failures. Whitland continues to refuel as required. Be cause of increased anthracite production the Burry Port-CwmMaw trains have been worked by two Class 08’s from 14th October.

Fishguard now has one freight train a day, 08.00 from Margam and 14.20 return diagrammed for a Class 35. No Class 35 now stables at Fishguard but one off the 03.10 Margam-Haverfordwest runs light to Fishguard to work the Trecwm freight.

The 05.50 Whitland-Pembroke Dock has reverted to Class 35 haulage. This train had the locomotive from the Kensington milk train but it now returns to Llanelli to work a Langley Green freight. The Class 46 for the up Kensington milk now works down on the 11.25 parcels from Cardiff.

On 22nd November 3744 was pilot at Carmarthen, 3986 was spare, 1596 was ready to work to Whitland for the Kensington milk, 7091 was on the 16.40 Milford Haven and 7088 was on the Newcastle Emlyn freight.

The use of Class 47’s on the coal trains from mid-Glamorgan via Tondu to Margam has been unsuccessful and trains will revert to Class 37 haulage any time.

On 26th October and 2nd November a considerable number of coal trains ran between Grange Junction and Margam with corresponding return journeys of empty wagons to Crewe. Beet, pulp/nuts trains have run from Kings Lynn, Bury St. Edmunds and Downham to Llanelli during October and November.

On 2nd November four coal trains ran from Washwood Heath to Uskmouth and three from South Wales to Carlisle. On Sun days, 9th, 16th and 23rd November special coal train ran from Radyr to the Rhymney Valley.

On 31st October there were no engines awaiting cutting up at Cashmores, Newport.

6993 was noted at Cardiff on 31st October with the letters AB-VB in the top left-hand corner of the power classification panel. This obviously stands for air brake-vacuum brake.

The following locomotives were noted as below :-

Saturday 15th November: 
Ebbw Vale steelworks: 4180
Aberdare High Level station: 6924/58/70
Aberdare yards: 3748
Pantyffynon: 3758, 6892, 6944/76/87
Carmarthen: 1936, 3744, 3986, 7056/86/7/8/91, the latter being at Canton the following day
Whitland: 4002
Llanelli: 1605, 6882, 6969/75/7/84/94, 7076
Swansea East Dock: 2120/2, 3593, 3743/60, 3823/5/7/8/9, 3987, 6604, 6880/6/7, 6931/3/4/89 
Margam in the late evening were 183, 1031/42/8/60, 1589/95/6/7, 1606/51, 1844, 1910/4/21, 3356, 3429-31/5-8, 4027, 6932, 7018/64/81.

The stabling points at Pontypool Road, Rhymney and Abercynon were derelict.

Sunday, 16th November:
Llantrisant: 3822, 6957/96
Radyr: 3515/94, 3603, 3753, 3960, 6600/1/3/6, 6878/85, 6909/43/92
Barry: 1904/17/8, 6941
Barry Docks: 3420/1/3/4.
Burry Port: 2141/2 and 2145 in store.

Landore: 1025/9/60/3/6/9/70, 1615/43/57/9/66/7/8/93, 1596, 1929/36, 2144, 3196, 3593,
4126/74, 6884, 6989 with 2121 in store on 23rd November. 9555/21 were also stabled in the shed yard, but 9524/36/8 were in the old Landore goods yard. S.R. boiler van from Southampton Docks DS 70185 was also noted. Landore’s remaining Class 03’s 2120/2 were at Swansea East Dock.

PENARTH#On 2nd November the engineers had total occupation of this branch for most of the day whilst altering the track layout at Penarth station.

A Class 08 shunter with diesel crane and train was in occupation of the line whilst the last remaining pointwork was taken out, thus reducing the branch to the absolute minimum,
simply a single line from Cogan Junction. A substitute bus service was provided during the day until the work was completed and the first train arrival over the new track was the 15.40 d.m.u. from Rhymney which left Penarth again at 17.05.

NORTH AND WEST VIA HEREFORD#The next timetable will see the withdrawal of all the through trains by this route which pass via Bristol, currently three on week-days, including the sleeping cars conveyed by the night train. The remaining service will be a mixture of the Cardiff-Manchester trains and the present stopping trains on the sections Crewe-Shrewsbury, Shrewsbury-Hereford, and Hereford-Newport, making most trains all stations Newport-Crewe and vice versa, connections at Hereford to/from Worcester being incidental.

GLOUCESTER#Bristol-based Class 08 4025 appears to be stabled at Gloucester, as it has been noted working Gloucester rosters since August. Class 42/43’s have been noted during September/October on a Monday to Friday express parcels working. The Warship usually arrives at Gloucester (Central) station around noon from Bristol and returns, usually light, to Bristol at approx. 13.00. Locomotives noted are 804/19/25/42/7/56/7/62/4/5. A Class 52 takes a turn on it as did 1052 Western Viceroy on 14th November.

A South Wales Pullman set passed Tramway Junction on 4th November. This was diverted because of derailed wagons at Severn Tunnel Junction. On 6th November Class 47 1847 (D05) appeared on a special freight to South Wales. This was quickly followed by 1851 (D05) on a 14-coach football excursion returning from Sheffield to Cardiff.

On 11th November Class 40 308 (D05) brought down a freight. It worked past Gloucester on this train but it is not known where it came off, they sometimes work as far as Severn Tunnel.

Class 37 locomotives have reappeared after a long absence, they work oil trains from Llandarcy to Rowley Regis,’ usually in pairs, 6969/75 being observed on 13th November.

Class 22 6354 has replaced 6352 on local workings which thus now have 6320/31/48/54. Class 47 1985 (52A) was borrowed for engineering work on the 16th and was seen bringing back empty ballast wagons.

On the 15th two excursions were run to London, on the return the second train was over two hours late in owing to the failure of a Class 47 at Sapperton on the first train. As this section is single line no train could pass until the offending train was moved.

Notable locomotives seen during November included: Class 47’s 1102 (52A), 1540 (D05), 1542 (34G), 1539 (52A), 1568 (41A), 1621 (D05), 1822 (D02), 1824 (D16), 1838/47/51/ (D05), 1860 (D02), 1869 (40B), 1880 (5IL), 1949 (D05), 1985 (52A)3 Class 25’s 5135 (D05), 5239/41/7/9 (D16), 7502 (D16), 7625 (55A) 7631 (D02), 7657/9 (D16); Class 31’s 5542 (41A), 5551 (40B), 5820/43 (41A).

Class 20’s 8005/10 (D16) passed on a southbound freight at 03.40 on 21st November.

CHELTENHAM#Sunday train diversions have been operating during November over the Honeybourne line, with trains running to Birmingham via Stratford. On 9th September the train from Sheffield to Paignton going forward from Birmingham at 21.30 was 

diverted due to a freight train derailment. A Redditch d.m.u. set 50327/59120/50309 was prepared quickly and formed the 21.30 to Bristol. Arrival at Bristol is timed for 23.37, but the train arrived only eight minutes late, having made the scheduled stops.

HEREFORD#A mighty hue and cry has been raised as a result of the timetable changes involving the Plymouth-Liverpool/Manchester expresses running via Gloucester as from May 1970. However, there will be some compensation in the fact that there will be seven trains running between Crewe and Cardiff (via Hereford) daily.

LONDON AREA#Merry-go-round coal trains have started to run to Didcot power station at the rate of three per week. The coal is being stacked ready for operation. At present coal is coming from Calverton Colliery and is received off 06.47 Bestwood Park returning at 14.10 to Calverton with the empty hoppers. 1830 (D16) was noted on this train. 

Oil to the Langley terminal has started to arrive from Immingham and the 12.50 Immingham-Langley return 21.10 Langley-Immingham have been running approximately twice per week. 1882 (40B) has been noted on this service.

The only Class 45 noted this month was 63 which worked 04.00 Gloucester-Acton special on 26th November. Class 25’s 5246/7504 worked a 22.00 Narborough-Hamworthy special through to Eastleigh and returned light to Banbury on the 11th and the next day were noted on 12.10 Banbury-Reading West Junction returning on the 14.50 Reading- Banbury. Another member of the Class, 7603, worked an 06.30 Burton-on-Trent-Didcot on the 5th with empty grain wagons for the maltsters at Wallingford.

Within the space of forty minutes two Class 31’s arrived at Oxford with empty Carflat trains on 8th November. 5853 was first to arrive on the 20.00 Grimsby-Oxford of the previous night followed by 5518 on an 03.00 Parkstone Quay-Oxford.

Over 2,000 car bodies have recently been exported to Jugoslavia from Morris Cowley via Parkestone Quay and Zeebrugge, approximately two trains per week were run using the 19.50 “Q” path.

A new car body service to Linwood in Scotland has commenced to run leaving Morris Cowley at 16.00 via Bletchley with W.R. Class 35’s. This also appears to be a twice weekly service.

PADDINGTON#Platform rebuilding was completed on 23rd November, on which date the Birmingham line underbridge at Old Oak Common was renewed with the result that an intensive train service was run on the Greenford loop.

REGION#SOUTHERN REGION

ROMSEY - ANDOVER LINE#At the end of October, track lifting between Kimbridge Junction and Andover Town was complete, and contractors were busy removing the last of the chairs from Mottisfont station where some of the lifted track had been stored and dismantled. Apart from the track, very little else has been removed from the line except a bridge near Mottisfont. All station buildings, the majority of signal boxes and some signals still remain, although in a very dilapidated condition.

SOMERSET & DORSET#South of Blandford Forum, this line is intact although it is understood that lifting will commence shortly. From the state of the rails, nothing has run over the line for a long time. At Broadstone, the junction with the L.S.W.R. line, the station and signalling is intact. Broadstone box is still open as a block-post for the daily freight on the remaining stub of the Ringwood line, to West Moors Army Department siding.

SALISBURY#The old steam running shed has now been demolished and the site levelled.

SOUTH WESTERN DIVISION#An unusual sight at approximately 18.50 on 30th October at Surbiton was 868 Zephyr hauling two three-car cross-country d.m.u’s. The units had formed a schools’ special from Sherbourne to Waterloo but had failed somewhere west of Salisbury. The services of a Class 35 were appropriated and hauled the ensemble to Waterloo. The Class 42 was returning the defective stock to the Western Region, and it is believed that the Class 35 worked the 19.10 Waterloo-Exeter St. Davids.

There was disruption to the evening peak hour working on 3rd November when the 17.02 Leatherhead-Waterloo broke away at Stoneleigh. At one stage, down trains on the Epsom line were queued back as far as Raynes Park whilst the trouble on the other line was rectified.

Two further illustrations of the continued unreliability of the Class 74 electro-diesels occurred on 4th November. E6102 working the 06.52 Eastleigh-Basingstoke failed at Shawford. After the driver had rectified the defect (electrical trouble), the train continued, but heavily delayed the 06.20 and 06.52 Bournemouth-Waterloo. A little later on the 06.35 Poole-Waterloo terminated at Woking when E6106 failed.

On 9th November the 14.47 Waterloo Weymouth spent about an hour at Brookwood when REP 3010 failed with defective traction motors. Assistance in the form of Class 73/2 E6048 came from Woking. Owing to engineering works on the same day, the 17.35 Weymouth-Waterloo was locomotive-hauled. Its motive power was Class 42 807 Caradoc. Unfortunately the locomotive disgraced itself by becoming a total failure near New Milton. The 18.56 Bournemouth-Waterloo propelled the train to Brockenhurst where it terminated, the luckless passengers going forward in what must have been very crowded conditions on the 18.56 Bournemouth-Waterloo.

On 12th November services in the Bourne mouth area were disrupted during the evening when E6101 was derailed in Bournemouth Central goods fouling the down line. Single line working was instituted over the up line between Bournemouth and Christchurch, but there were heavy delays and cancellations. Slow Waterloo-Bournemouth trains terminated and turned back at Brockenhurst.

Morning peak-hour services were delayed on 17th November by a points failure at the beginning of the period at Hampton Court Junction. Up services on the Alton line were delayed when the 08.04 Alton-Waterloo broke away between Ash Vale and Pirbright Junction.

The following morning peak period services were more heavily delayed after a driver of an up train reported a suspected broken rail on the up through line near Weybridge. The line was closed from approximately 07.55 and 08.55 for inspection, but no defect was found. On the same morning engineering work between Raynes Park and New Malden closed the down local line until approximately 09.30. This work had over-run its schedule and meant that trains for the Kingston and Hampton Court lines had to run on the through line and could not call at Raynes Park. This caused the unusual sight of passengers using the derelict down through line platform at New Malden.

On 20th November REP 3009 forming part of the 18.46 Waterloo-Weymouth had to stop at Brookwood whilst the driver secured loose shoe-leads. The train terminated at Basing stoke, but unfortunately some shoes had been deposited in the West Byfleet area, and damaged the shoe-beam on the following 18.50 Waterloo Portsmouth Harbour which proceeded to Woking where the front unit had to be detached.

A passenger van was derailed at Clapham Junction at approximately 12.20 on 24th November affecting Windsor line services. For a time Windsor line services started and terminated at Clapham Junction, but all lines were Clear at approximately 17.30.

CENTRAL DIVISION#Repairs to the second of the weak bridges at Battersea were carried out in mid-November, the work commencing at 20.00 on the 14th and extending throughout the 15th and 16th. Although the block was of shorter duration than when the first bridge was dealt with last April, the effect on train services was on the whole more severe this time because the centre of activity was the bridge taking the Central Division main lines over the Longhedge “low-level”
tracks and the latter were therefore not avail able for diversions. To make matters worse,
track maintenance work was also in progress outside Victoria throughout the week-end,
as a result of which even the South London line trains could not get beyond Battersea Park, and Victoria (Central) was completely closed to rail traffic. Contact with Central Division routes was, however, maintained by a half-hourly train service between Victoria (Eastern) and Gatwick Airport via Herne Hill, calling at Tulse Hill, Streatham Common, Selhurst and East Croydon. The Newhaven boat trains also ran from and to Victoria (Eastern) via Herne Hill and Streatham. Suburban services generally terminated at Clapham Junction and main line trains were diverted to London Bridge, the latter arrangements being very similar to those employed in April except that the Bognor/Portsmouth expresses on this occasion ran via Peckham Rye and called at Tulse Hill to connect with the Victoria-Gatwick service. On the Sunday, a half-hourly suburban service operated be tween London Bridge and West Croydon via Tulse Hill and Crystal Palace, while the ordin ary London Bridge-Brighton stopping trains, which normally go via Crystal Palace on Sun days, ran via the main line.

Now that both the defective bridges have been reconstructed, regular passengers are hoping for improved timekeeping, although at the end of November speed restrictions were still in force. The special signalling, installed some time ago to restrict the use of the bridges by simultaneous train movements, has been removed.

Engineering work at Battersea on 9th November caused closure of the local lines between Battersea Park and Clapham Junction. Trains were stopping at the platform
(No. 5) on the down through line at Battersea Park, but as there is no platform serving the up through line, there were no trains that day from Clapham Jct. to Battersea Park. Passengers had to travel via Victoria.

As elsewhere, the number of major block ages for week-end engineering work on this Division continues to increase, with sometimes as many as five or six in operation at the same time, and travel on Sundays can be hazardous business for the unwary, particularly those attempting cross-country journeys involving connections. Individual examples include a lengthy possession at Clayton on_ several Sundays in October and November when London-Brighton passengers had to travel via, and in many cases change at, Lewes, while the Worthing people had to go via Littlehampton. On a number of week-ends in September/October the Eastbourne and Hastings services were interrupted by work near Polegate and on several of these occasions Hastings travellers were denied the alternative of a through service on the Charing Cross route, as this also was blocked near Mountfield. Further west, relaying near Fishbourne required a long series of possessions with closure of the coast line between Chichester and Bosham. On 30th November, Brighton-Eastbourne services were using London Road as their terminal, due to work outside Brighton, and for part of the day they could not get into Eastbourne either, owing to operations at Hampden Park, and had to finish their journey at Polegate.

A special train for the Decca company was run on the afternoon of 9th November, the empty stock for which was noted at Battersea Park shortly after 14.00, consisting of “‘Belle’’ sets 3052/3. Special roof-boards were carried, bearing the name of the firm, but one was observed carrying the legend The Regency Belle. This dates from the experiment a few years ago, when a 5-BEL set was chartered for an evening trip to Brighton and back, by a private sponsor. Another private special utilising one of these units was noted on 15th November when a 5-BEL formation ran from Charing Cross to Brighton; this must have been a most unusual sight at Charing Cross.

On 8th November a rail tour from Victoria to Shoeburyness was formed of 6S Hastings d.e.m.u. 1005. This is probably the first appearance of one of these on the Tilbury and Southend line. A 6L unit formed the 18.15 London Bridge-Hurst Green on 27th November, in place of the normal locomotive hauled set.

On 8th and 9th November a 2-SAP unit, 5634, appeared on South London line ser vices; trains on this line appear to be formed on occasions of almost any type of suburban unit (4-SUB’s and 4-EPB’s are often seen) but nominally main-line or outer-suburban units appear very infrequently. This is probably the first of the newly-classified 2-SAP set to be used on this line. Trains are normally worked by 2-EPB units.

On the week-end of 11th/12th October, three-aspect colour-light signalling was in troduced between Sutton and Mitcham Junction, and Hackbridge signal box was closed. Earlier, the up Tulse Hill line at Peckham Rye Junction was relaid on an improved alignment. The last year or two has seen a marked betterment in timekeeping on the Sutton-Mitcham Junction-London Bridge route, with the elimination of semaphore signals. By contrast, punctuality on |some of the Epsom Downs services has deteriorated.

Twelve condemned two-car electric units (HAL and BIL) have been partially stripped internally for use as parcels trains during the |pre-Christmas period. Six of these units - 10 five HAL and one BIL - were berthed in the down siding at Balcombe on 27th November.

SOUTH EASTERN DIVISION#On 11th November a most unusual formation of electric units was seen at London Bridge, apparently forming the 09.20 Sanderstead-Cannon Street. The train was formed of sets 5617 (2-SAP), 7184 (4-CEP), and 5166 (4-EPB)!

On 4th November 4-SUB units penetrated to Holborn Viaduct; 4728 and 4673 were noted at Elephant and Castle forming the 09.33 Holborn-Wimbledon.

On Friday, 13th November, the 21.40 Victoria to Ramsgate and Dover train, consisting of two 4-CEP sets, arrived at Faversham a few minutes late and stopped at platform 2. The two sets were separated and the usual announcement about ‘front four cars for Ramsgate, rear four for Dover’? was made. There followed an unusually long wait, after which the rear (Dover) unit suddenly and with out warning shot off backwards, out of the station, over the crossover, and on to the
“up’’ line. There it paused, reversed, and ran, more slowly this time, over the same cross over and into platform 1. It halted momentarily at the platform, then continued on its way, over the points and on to the Dover line, leaving the four-car Ramsgate portion still standing where it had originally stopped at platform 2. No explanation of this strange manoeuvre was offered.

REGION#EASTERN REGION

L.T.S. SECTION#On 13th November 8055 was goods pilot at Southend Central in place of the usual Class 31.

An enthusiasts’ tour from Victoria, consisting of S.R. Hastings set 1005 was noted passing through Southend Central towards Shoeburyness at 12.00, returning westwards at 12.35.

Vandalism near Bromley-by-Bow caused a complete signal failure as far as Fenchurch Street at 17.45 on 11th November. The terminus virtually came to a standstill for forty five minutes while the down lines were cleared of waiting trains. The damage was repaired by 23.00.

Commuters suffered a further disruption to services on 14th November when there was a points failure in Barking station at 07.55. The 07.10 from Southend Central reached its destination twenty minutes late and at 09.30 trains were still arriving about half-an-hour late. At 08.30 the down line between Upton Park and Barking was occupied by eight trains held at signals.

G.E. SECTION#Stratford’s shunting du ties appear to have been reduced, with only two Class 04 shunters, 2217/23, remaining active. The former was noted at Mile End on 26th October. Class 08’s total twenty-three, of which ten were on shed on 26th October, the remainder at Ripple Lane (2). Ilford, Leyton, Harlow Mill, Thornton Field with two at Doncaster Works. The two Class 10’s have been transferred. Nine of the Class 11’s were on shed, with one each in Stratford Works, Stratford Market, Temple Mills wagon shop, Bow and Grays. 2216/76, 12116/28/37 were in store on this date. 3301/2/3/34, 3681/2/3 and 4191 are currently radio telephone fitted. Class 43 837 Ramillies was in Stratford Works on 9th November for wheel-turning. On the following Sunday, 16th, Class 35 7100 (81A) was in Works for the same purpose.

W.R. Class 47 not previously reported on the 17.30 from Liverpool St. include 1640, 1646. Visitors on this duty have included 1695 (D02).

On 10th November the 11.40 arrival in Liverpool] St. appeared at 12.10 behind Class 31 5576 instead of a Class 47. The following day the same train arrived punctually behind 5578.

Automatic ticket machines have been in stalled near platforms 1-4 at Liverpool St. Tickets are dispensed for stations on the Chingford, Enfield and Lea Valley lines while there is a selection of machines taking all current coins up to 10p. (2/-).

The first details of the revised electric time table to be introduced in May 1970 have appeared in the local Southend press. Unfortunately they have been contradictory but it seems likely that the present service of non stop trains to Billericay or from Billericay will be reduced when the trains serve Shenfield as well. The twelve-car trains will not be affected by this arrangement and will run as at present. The changes in the timetable take account of the travel census held in November 1968 and the increase of traffic from some Stations (The L.T.S. section is also affected by the changes.)

The travel news on the National radio ser vice for the morning peak of 18th November warned commuters on the Lea Valley electric lines that the services would be severely reduced due to a shortage of stock. Normal ser vices were running by 12.00 but for the following two days the LTS section had a noticeable shortage of stock at peak periods.

A sudden frost during the evening of 18th November caused chaos around Stratford when the points froze. The 23.24 to Southend Victoria took 100 minutes to pass Stratford having retraced its journey for some distance in the up direction to avoid the section where the points were frozen. According to reports in the national press one driver was considering taking up road sweeping as it would pay better and he wouldn’t have to suffer the wrath of passengers delayed by incidents of this nature.
(The points in the area affected are fitted with heaters.)

LEA VALLEY LINE#Although the electric service over this line has been operating since 5th May last, improvements to stations and structures has been slow. By the end of November the new booking offices at Northumberland Park and Ponders End were nearing completion. Lifting barriers replaced the conventional level crossing gates at Brimsdown on and from 16th November. The station buildings at Angel Road have been demolished and replaced by “bus stop” type waiting shelters constructed of galvanised sheeting and glass, similar shelters have also been constructed on both up and down platforms at Ponders End. Fluorescent lighting is in use at all stations but much to the discomfort of passengers the troughing for the wiring between the posts has not been filled in by the con tractors, so that small ditches run the whole length of the platforms where lighting posts have been erected. In addition to the pro vision of new mileage posts, new gradient posts have also been erected between Copper Mill Junction and Cheshunt Junction. According to national and local Press reports the station buildings at Brimsdown, Enfield Lock and Waltham Cross are to be demolished and replaced by new brick-built single storey structures in chocolate and cream brickwork.

CAMBRIDGE#Class 08 3661 joined 3608/10/1 at this depot to cover the sugar beet traffic at Bury St. Edmunds.

All services to Liverpool St. on 2nd November were diverted via Hitchin and Stratford due to engineering work between Roydon and Broxbourne. Trains were re-timed with approximately thirty minutes added to the schedule.

On 13th November 1574 was observed running up the goods line at 14.40, hauling heating boiler DB968003 (ex-Class 15), still in green livery and presumably en route for the London area.

MARCH#On the retirement of the March stationmaster, the Whitemoor yardmaster has taken over his responsibilities. Plans have been published for changing March station into an “‘unstaffed halt’’, but at present these are being held in abeyance.

WISBECH & UPWELL#Work began on lifting the track of the tramway on 27th October, the contractors being J. Watling & Son Ltd. of Leverington Common. By 12th November the track had been lifted from Elm Road crossing, Wisbech, to Elm tram station corner. The delay in placing the contract appears to have been due to a protracted legal battle over the ownership of the land used by the tramway, and although this has been settled, the decision has not been made public. However, one condition of the contract is that the bed of the track must be filled in with earth and levelled ready for seeding. The local Press reported that “County Councils own only the metalled surface of any road, and the soil beneath belongs to the owners of the property at either side of the road’’. So it seems as if the bed of the railway may become the property of the house owners. Work is expected to take some ten to sixteen weeks to complete.

COLCHESTER#On 22nd November the following were present at the Colchester diesel depot: 2278/97, 3134, 3299, 3684/92, 3918, 4186, 6728, 6964/8 and 8242. Stored in a siding at the rear were Class 04 shunters 2277/85/96 (all condemned). Apparently a handful of the 04’s allocated here are still active, and 2278 appeared to be undergoing light repair inside the depot. It was also interesting to note that ‘‘D’’ prefixes had been removed from only two of the locomotives present, 4186 and 6728 (in blue livery).

MALDON-WITHAM#All track has been removed from this branch, the operation being completed during the early summer. It is proposed to run a pipeline for North Sea oil along the track-bed from Witham primarily to Langford and finally into Maldon, and contractors are occupying the yard at Maldon East station in connection with this scheme.

FELIXSTOWE#The new curve is not yet in use. The yard at Town station is being used increasingly for the storage of freight trains to and from the Dock, all week long and not merely at weekends, which suggest that the direct route cannot be reinstated before adequate storage facilities become available at the Dock. Felixstowe is, incidentally, said to have now become the third largest container port in Europe, after Rotterdam and Antwerp, which augurs well for B.R.

G.N. SECTION#On 18th October the prototype 4,000 h.p. locomotive HS4000 Kestrel appeared at Kings Cross on a special train. This comprised six coaches, four of which were catering vehicles. It presented a striking comparison with Class 55 9004 Queens Own Highlander (64B) in the adjacent platform, being much the larger and heavier machine. Kestrel subsequently retired to the diesel depot at Finsbury Park.

On 8th October, the up “Yorkshire Pullman” arrived no less than fourteen minutes early behind Class 47 1997 (52A). This shows the 175.5 miles from Wakefield to Kings Cross were covered in 156 minutes, representing an average speed of 67.5 m.p.h#precisely the allowance of the Deltic-hauled down train. During the first week of October, Cambridge trains were graced with some unusual locomotives. On 1st October Class 40 281 hauled the 11.35 Cambridge-Kings Cross and the following day saw the 17.54 Kings Cross Cambridge in charge of Class 46 172 (52A).

Visitors noted at Kings Cross recently |have included 6731 (50B) on 1Al1 Hull-Kings Cross on 29th October and 1905 (86A) on 13.09 arrival ex-Leeds and Bradford on 17th November. Locomotives noted in the station yard included 5854 (31B) on 27th October, 224 Lucania (D08) on 3rd November, and 202 (D09) on 14th.

HITCHIN# On 16th November the complete locomotive allocation was present at the depot, Class 08 shunters 3688-91, 3704/8, also 5614/49, 5902/9, and 34G Class 47 1761. A further Class 08 is on loan to cover a temporary duty involving track lifting near St. Neots; the locomotive on this date 3718 being on the Hitchin duty at Hatfield. The “Baby Deltics” that remain still operate mainly from this depot, but there was no sign of 5901 returning from Derby Research Centre and 5902 was waiting for works attention due to loose tyres and may not be repaired.

Track rationalisation at Hitchin to allow 100 m.p.h. running through the station has been taking place in recent weeks. On 23rd November, the crossover at Hitchin Yard box, north of the station, was taken out, and there is now no connection between the up and down sides of the layout, except at Hitchin South, over a quarter-of-a-mile away. This means a long trip along the slow lines for transfer freights and for vans from the parcels depot to the up side. Whilst the work was being carried out, down main line trains used the down slow line, and up main line and Cambridge trains the up slow line. This was being worked as a single line, however, as down Cambridge trains had to reverse to the up slow at Hitchin South, work wrong line through the station, and gain access to the down branch via the up goods yard!

NEWARK#On 21st November there was considerable delay to down expresses due to 1517 (55B) failing on 1L20 14.20 Kings Cross York. 1104 (34G) was noted on 1835 14.00 Kings Cross-Edinburgh running sixty-seven minutes late, followed by 1105 (34G) on IN1I8 15.00 down Newcastle twenty-nine minutes late, then 1111 (55B) on 1L20 14.20 down 105 minutes late and out of course, closely followed by 9017 The Durham Light Infantry (52A) on 1L22 15.55 down Leeds forty-eight minutes late. The Cleethorpes connection off the 14.20 down left on time,
and the branch passengers caught the connection of the 16.20 down. On the same day two G.E. section Class 37’s were noted- 6964 (31B) running up light and 6865 (30A) on 4E35 Bathgate-Ripple Lane.

On the 22nd, 1771 (30A) came down on 6233 special petrol, and returned up light to Colwick. Class 20’s 8134 + 8166 (D16) worked 9Z73 special coal empties from Colwick to Doncaster, and returned light. It is most unusual to see this class on the main line between Doncaster and Newark. Class 31 5544 (41A) ran up light and towed down 1517 (55B) which had failed the day before. The up “Flying Scotsman” was running 78 minutes late behind 164 (52A), and overtook 1763 (34G) whilst it was standing in the station on 1A26 Leeds-Kings Cross. Then followed the most unusual spectacle of two Deltics on an express-9004 64B and 9017 52A on 1A28 Leeds-Kings Cross. 9004 must have been detached at Grantham, since it returned down light within an hour.

LINCOLN AREA#With regard to the note on p. 380, November 1969 R.O. concerning the Highdyke iron ore trains, 8D95 08.35 Grantham-Barnetby was hauled by Class 47 1564 on 19th November. Further, this locomotive did not return with 8D79 12.00 Barnetby-Highdyke, as stated, but was seen returning light through Lincoln St. Marks later that afternoon. It was quickly followed by Class 25 7527, returning to the L.M.R.

In recent weeks, the area has seen an in crease in the number of workings by Class 40’s. On 7th November 274 (55B) was in Lincoln diesel depot. Later that evening it worked to Newark and back light, though precisely why is not known. Several have been seen working mid-afternoon freights south over the avoiding line. This is surprising as their route availability is 7, as is that of Classes 45/46, yet they are permitted over the avoiding line, whereas the Peaks are not. On the passenger trains, Class 40’s are quite commonly put in charge of the 10.00 York-Yarmouth, though the appearance of 353 (56B) on the northbound counterpart (1L48 10.38 ex Yarmouth) on 19th November was very unusual. This locomotive was marked ‘“NB’’, though there appeared to be steam-heating in Operation, judging from the cloud of steam escaping from the connecting pipes between the locomotive and the first coach and a locomotive without steam-heating would hardly be a suitable choice in the middle of November! This train has a different locomotive every few weeks and has, since September, been hauled by Classes 25, 31, 37, 40, 47 and drawn from allocations as far apart as the Midland Lines, Tinsley and March.

Over the week-end of 15th/16th November extensive engineering works were undertaken on the East Coast main line between Peter borough and Doncaster. Engineering work was under way at Ranskill and Bawtry (23.00 Sat.-20.00 Sun.), Grantham yard and Grantham North (22.15 Sat.-16.15 Sun.) and also at Newark (23.30 Sat.-16.30 Sun.), where the flat crossing between the Lincoln Nottingham line and the main line was being re-laid. As a result, main line traffic was diverted via the G.N./G.E. Joint Line, through Sleaford, Lincoln Central and Gainsborough Lea Road, regaining the main line at Black Carr Junction just south of Doncaster. In the down direction all trains from the SO 20.30 Kings Cross-Edinburgh to the SUN 14.00 Kings Cross-Edinburgh were diverted, while diversions on the up line spanned, with two exceptions, all services from the SO 20.20 Newcastle-Kings Cross to the SUN 09.30 Aberdeen-Kings Cross. the two exceptions were the SUN _ 12.15  Edinburgh-Kings Cross and the SUN 16.50 Leeds-Kings Cross which rather curiously ran via the normal route. Apart from these expresses, the only other train diverted was the 3A03 parcels train on the Sunday morning. It travelled via Lincoln avoiding line, though all other trains were routed through the Central station.

Between 11.00 and 19.00 on the Sunday,
seventeen expresses and the parcels train travelled via Lincoln. With one exception,
all were hauled either by Deltics or Class 47 The exception was the SUN 13.50 Leeds-Kings Cross, which arrived at Lincoln Central twelve minutes late behind Class 40 257 (55B). Time-keeping was erratic, though it was evident that the Deltics were giving a generally better performance than were the Class 47s. The average punctuality of all seventeen expresses was 10.5 minutes late, the nine Deltic-hauled trains averaging 8.8 minutes late and the seven Class 47-hauled services 12.6 minutes late. Of these seventeen trains, one was six minutes early, another precisely on time and a third, one minute late only. All three were Deltic-hauled. In contrast, no Class 47-hauled train arrived even within five minutes of schedule, the minimum lateness being seven minutes. Although the maximum speed limit on the Joint Line is only 60 m.p.h., the 3,300 h.p. engine capacity of the Deltics gives them a considerable advantage when accelerating heavy trains from the several severe speed restrictions along its length. This advantage is now all the greater in view of the derating of some of the Class 47s. from 2,750 h.p. to 2,580 h.p., due to engine stress troubles.

The current locomotive allocation of Lincoln comprises eight 204 h.p. Class 03 shunters and nine 350 h.p. of Classes 08 and 10. Those present on 9th November were 2021/2/3/5/6, 3277, 3347/87 and 3533. The only main line diesel was 5230 (D16).

Sunday stabling points for this depot include: East Holmes sidings, Lincoln-5522, 5666 (both 31B), and 6803 (41A); Newark Northgate station-3205; Grantham station- 1558/65 5671/2; in the engineers yard 1561 and 1786 were on duty. The local goods pilot, 4061, was not noted, the stabling location would help. Boston goods yard 2024, 2135 and 4075; (A third Class 03 duty here-2027-is believed to stable at Sleaford) and Spalding Coal yard-4065 and 5828 (40B). The other Lincoln based shunter 3201 was in Works.

At about 08.00 on 20th September, a Longtown-Felixstowe ammunition train became derailed at Trent Jct. Gainsborough, ten vans blocking both the Lincoln-Sheffield and Lincoln-Doncaster lines. The Lincoln Sheffield (Midland) d.m.u. services were terminated at Gainsborough, buses taking the passengers to Retford where they joined trains for Sheffield which were reversed at this point. 1M72 the daily Parkeston Quay Manchester Boat train was diverted at Pyewipe Jct. Lincoln on to the old L.D. & E.C.R. line to Shireoaks, where it rejoined the line to Sheffield. A special stop was made at Shireoaks, to set down passengers for Retford and Worksop, who were conveyed to their destination by ’bus. The only passenger train booked to use the Lincoln-Doncaster line, 1N48 11.40 Lincoln-Newcastle ran as follows :-Lincoln (Central)-Pelham Junction (reversal)-Lincoln (St. Marks)-Newark (Northgate) (reversal)-Doncaster. A d.m.u. was run in the path of 1N48 from Lincoln-to Gainsborough to cater for travellers to that place. Two breakdown cranes attended the derailment, the Immingham crane returning through Lincoln at 11.45. The line was soon cleared but as a result of the accident, the planned East Coast Main Line diversions for that night were cancelled.

On 25th September British Rail announced their latest plans for the re-organisation of the railway system in Lincoln. The new plan calls for the retention of the Newark-Lincoln Barnetby line for passenger and freight traffic and the Sleaford-Lincoln (Avoiding Line) Retford line for freight and for passenger traffic from Lincoln-Retford. The present Central and St. Marks Stations would be closed and a new ‘Super Station’ built on the Lincoln-Barnetby line on the site of the present East yard. A new junction would be put in on the site of the present St. Marks Station and a spur line would run from this, through to the present West yard to join on to the existing Lincoln-Retford line somewhere near the present West Holmes Junction. Freight traffic would presumably be handled in a truncated Holmes yard, or in the present much reduced St. Marks or East yards. The cost of the new station is stated to be not less than £750,000, of which the City of Lincoln would be expected to provide at least £200,000.

FRODINGHAM#At the depot on 9th November were 1523(41A)/38/50/64, 5551/77/86 5673/9(30A)/88, 5803/27(41A)/36(41A)/62, 6719 (41A), 6827(S1L) and the only shunter 3647. The main line diesels are all based at 40B unless indicated. The depot’s other six 350 h.p. shunters were outstabled at Dawes Lane, Scunthorpe Yard (2), North Lincoln Works, Wilby Works, and Trent Junction.

IMMINGHAM#The following locomotives were present on 9th November: 1529/39/53/4/5/76/7(64B), 1750(D05)/75(34G), 87, 1800/33/6/66, 3312, 3427/8. 3507/49, 4053/62 and also 4056/70 which are stored, the latter being a recent transfer from store at Stratford. Duties for diesel shunters in Lincolnshire have been revised, and this depot now has only 350 h.p. shunters which are normally restricted to duties in the Immingham and Grimsby areas. The Goods Depot at Grimsby Market stables the ‘East Marsh’ shunters-(4049/59/63/79 on this date)-and one stables at Grimsby Town station (4068). A sixth Grimsby duty is called ‘West Marsh’ and those outstabled in the Immingham area were on the following duties :-Transit Shed, high level dock (12118 on this turn), Empty sidings, Mineral Quay, Reception sidings (Humber Road), West Dock, and a general Dock pilot, More detailed locations would be welcomed. One shunter (3195) was in Works. Since this visit it has been learnt that 3320 has been transferred here w/e 18th October, but it would appear not to have arrived by 9th November.

DONCASTER#On the occasion of the Society visit on 2nd November the following locomotives were at the works :-

Arrival sidings: 3334, 5570/90, 5647/51, 6783, 6865, 6951/89, 8229/34, Crimpsall shop: 5514, 5603/17/81/5, 5807/10, 6743, 6912/5/36/79, 8204, 9009/14. Shunter Bay: 2049, 2174, 3079, 3195, 3201. Stripping Shop: 2007, 6995, 8214. Outside stripping shop: 3575, 3609, 4192 (Frame & Cab only), 5842. Side of Crimpsall: DB968003 (Ex 8203). Outside Weigh House: 5571, 5679, 5820. Paint shop: 6720/80. Departure sidings: 5566, 6959. Works pilots: 3512/35.

Withdrawn shunters on Doncaster shed on same day were 3621/39/49, 12125/35.

Ex-works on. shed. 2102/37/47. All repainted standard blue.

An unusual visitor on shed was Class 40 224 Lucania.

Deltic 9014 is now painted in blue livery, the last of Class to be so treated.

HUDDERSFIELD#A level-crossing is being constructed at the viaduct end of the station, and has resulted in the length of platforms 4 and 5 being reduced by 75 feet and No. 1 platform by some 15 feet. Slaithwaite station was demolished during November. On the Penistone branch, single line working between Clayton West Jct. and Penistone commenced on 24th November. In connection with the introduction of extended services to Sheffield Midland, a Derby single unit rail car has been noted on crew training duties. Following the coal strike, traffic to Huncoat power station has been erratic. Twenty five loaded wagons is now the limit on the downhill run between Clayton West Jct. and Huddersfield, abolishing the practice of pinning down brakes at Stocksmoor. Although the preserve of Classes 37 and 40, the “Drummer’’ was hauled by a locomotive of Class 46 on 20th November while occasional appearances of Class 47 have been noted.

Hillhouse yard now has an impoverished air. Between twenty-five and thirty wagons are exchanged daily, while five wagons of soda ash arrive at Huddersfield where they are elevated into the goods warehouse. To relieve the 15.42 Newcastle-Liverpool, a Friday evening York-Manchester relief was introduced on 31st October, the train being hauled by 28. 254 was used on 7th November, 6731 on 21st and 270 on 28th. An increase in the numbers of Class 47’s used on the Liverpool-Newcastle trains produced 1539 on the 15.42 ex-Newcastle on 28th November while the 17.05 ex-Liver pool was hauled by 1760 on 31st October, 1997 on 7th November, 1763 on 21st and 1998 on 22nd, but this regularity was broken on the 14th when 285 was employed.

The Fridays only relief to the foregoing, the 17.30 Manchester-York was hauled by 274 on 31st October, 7560 on 7th November, 324 on the 14th, 7636 on the 21st and 217 on the 28th. Patronage on this train, which became thin following the eclipse of steam, has shown a welcome increase. It is anticipated that when the Huddersfield stop is reinstated to the current 09.00 Liverpool-Newcastle it will run an hour earlier throughout.

WAKEFIELD - KNOTTINGLEY#During November the varied selection of motive power noted at Featherstone included the following: 1509 on the 3rd, with 384 (D08) appearing on the next day and 257 (55B) on the 5th. The somewhat unusual pairing of 5862 (40B) and 6948 (55C) was seen on the morning of the 13th when these were noted coupled together travelling light in the direction of Wakefield. 1959 and 1743 (D05) were amongst Class 47’s noted on 4E69 freightliner which generally passed through at about 21.30. These were seen on the 11th and 14th respectively.

KEIGHLEY#During the early hours of llth October a Nottingham-Carlisle goods was derailed by Keighley station resulting in traffic being diverted for much of the day. The 10.25 Leeds-Glasgow ran via York and the Class 46-hauled ‘“‘Thames-Clyde Express’’ ran via the Calder Valley to Blackburn and regained its normal route at Hellifield. Delays occurred on the following day (Sunday) when two Class 46’s were used on relaying, 135 being used on the breakdown train and of the few trains to pass through the 12.47 ex-Morecambe, the up ‘““Thames-Clyde’’ and 08.35 and 15.45 Leeds-Morecambe all used Platform 1. The foregoing is the fourth such mishap between Keighley and Bingley within the past two years, attributed to long wheel base bogie bolsters, which were also held responsible for the Kirkstall derailment some months ago.

BRADFORD#The problem of thousands of starlings nightly roosting in the roof girders of Exchange station became the object of an experiment carried out by the Disinfestation section of the B.R. Research Dept., a powerful light was employed, flashing every few seconds.

LEEDS#A spate of demolition work undertaken over the past twelve months saw the obliteration of the old carriage shed at Neville Hill by 18th October; five days earlier the bridge formerly used by the up ‘“‘new’’ line to cross the A62 near Farnley Jct. was lifted, while earlier, the greater portion of the long bridge that carried the route leading out of Leeds Central station over Northern Street was removed.

YORK#Bolton Percy station was demolished in early October. A derailment at Swinton on 18th October caused passengers from the 07.03 Sheffield Midland-York to alight at Rotherham and transfer to a special bus that was to convey them to Bolton-on Dearne, where a connecting train would await their arrival. The driver of the bus unfamiliar with the area, lost his way, reversed three times and after abortively consulting passengers reached the station after the connection had left. Passengers ultimately reached York aboard the 07.45 Birmingham-Newcastle which was running twenty minutes late.

TEESSIDE#Intermittent points failures still occur at Eaglescliffe, where the layout was revised during the 1968/9 winter. These failures sometimes occur in the up crossover points north of the station. When this happens the practice is for the Saltburn-Darlington d.m.u’s to run through on the goods line east of the station and then set back into the platform, with little delay.

A more serious occurrence is for the junction of the up Darlington/Northallerton line, south of the station, to fail. This occurred on 20th November, with the result that the 06.55 Saltburn had to be diverted via Northallerton. Passengers for the 08.05 Darlington-Kings Cross were told to alight there but, since this train had already passed through, their fate is unknown. Darlington was reached nearly an hour late, just ahead of the 07.25 Saltburn (two trains later) which had travelled the normal route through Dinsdale.

Class 31’s have been visitors to the area recently, 5568 (40B) being noted on the 28th and 5655 (40B) on 29th November, both having worked down from York on freight trains.

DARLINGTON#For the F.A. Cup first round match between Darlington and Barnsley an excursion was run behind Class 47 1575 (41A). Unfortunately, arrival at Darlington was one hour late, owing to the locomotive failing, and 5163 was sent out to haul the train in. Whilst the empty stock was being shunted in the station, the end vehicle (SO E4536) was rammed into an end loading dock
(at the north end of number 1 platform) and torn from one of the bogies. The return special was replaced by an eight-car d.m.u.

The Geneva loop, which gave direct access from the Dinsdale line to the up East Coast main line, has been lifted, following removal of the Engineer’s Dept. tracks. Geneva box is still manned.

LOCOMOTIVE WORKINGS#Apart from the newly created York duties (see p. 421 December, 1969 R.O.), there has been an increase in workings from other sheds to London since 6th October, 1969. All five locomotives on Haymarket’s Class 47 East Coast workings now come through to Kings Cross; one covers 08.08 SX Edinburgh-New castle, 12.00 Newcastle-Doncaster and 16.32 Doncaster-Kings Cross, returning north on 22.30 SX Kings Cross-Edinburgh; it subsequently works 22.30 Sun. Edinburgh Kings Cross. The other four cover liner trains 21.35 SX Glasgow-Kings Cross (4E61) and 22.16 MSX Edinburgh-Stratford (4E78) or 2020 MO Newcastle-Kings Cross; they fill in by working to Cambridge SX at 14.04, return 16.31 and 11.34, return 13.35, respectively, before going north with 19.53 SX Kings Cross Glasgow (4888) and 19.27 SX _ Stratford Glasgow (4883). They also cover respectively 22.45 SO Kings Cross-Leeds, 09.20 Sun., Leeds-Kings Cross and 19.40 Sun. Kings Cross-Edinburgh; 10.20 SO Kings _ Cross Leeds, 20.40 SO Leeds-Doncaster, 03.45 Sun. Doncaster-Grimsby and 18.53 Sun. Grimsby Kings Cross.

There are now three Holbeck workings for Class 47 diesels. Two cover the 08.40 Leeds Edinburgh and 17.12 return, then 00.01 MX Stourton-Stratford (4C66), 09.20 SX, 09.40 Sun. Kings Cross-Leeds, 15.35 SX, 16.50 Sun. Leeds-Kings Cross and 23.45 SX Stratford Stourton (4L64). The third works 10.20 SX Kings Cross-Leeds and 19.36 SX Leeds

Doncaster (6D63) and 23.05 SX Doncaster Temple Mills (6C66), being spare in London over the week-end.

As many as five Immingham-based Class 47’s now work up to London. The two daily Cleethorpes trains (one, Sunday) take care of two, the locomotive off the first up train during the week works at 13.34 daily Kings Cross-Cambridge and 15.35 return before returning on the 19.00 to Cleethorpes. A further locomotive covers 18.25 SX Kings Cross-Doncaster and 01.30 Doncaster-Temple Mills (6C62) and local freight working to Kings Cross goods (it is spare at Hornsey over the week-end). A fourth hauls the daily cement trains 6S45 and 6052 between Cliffe or Hoo Junction, and Doncaster. The final working covers 13.15 FO Hull-Kings Cross, 19.30 FO Kings Cross-Edinburgh, 04.50 SO Millerhill-Tyne (7E65) and 00.04 Sun. Newcastle-Doncaster (3A03). After a long rest at Doncaster until 10.45 3A03 is worked up to Kings Cross by a Tinsley Class 47, which then goes light to Hitchin and gets back to Doncaster on 8D04 (21.00 ex-Hitchin). Only one other Tinsley locomotive is scheduled to come to London, on the Sheffield liner trains.

The majority of other trains are covered by Gateshead Class 47’s. The latter have two fill-in turns to Cambridge SX, on 07.05 and 09.05 down and 09.35 and 11.35 up.

REGION#SCOTTISH REGION

DETAIL ALTERATIONS#Class 55 9014 The Duke of Wellington’s Regiment was noted at Haymarket on 21st November in blue. It was fitted with bonnet hooters as also is 9001. Another modified Class 47, 1512, was on the 08.05 Waverley-Aberdeen on 31st October.

TIME KEEPING#The 08.00 Kings Cross Edinburgh has continued an unenviable reputation. It was 70 minutes late on 15th November, fifty-six minutes late with 1872 on 19th and eighty minutes late with 9005 on 26th November; these were the only three occasions on which the train was noted. On the last occasion the stated cause was “engine trouble” in stead of “engine failure”, perhaps indicating that 9005 continued on the train through lack of a replacement. It is understood that increased freight traffic has reduced the number of stand-by locomotives. Presumably things will get worse until new power is available-perhaps in 1973! The 10.00 ex-Kings Cross strangely enough does not appear to suffer so many failures while the hard-worked diesel sets on the Edinburgh Glasgow continue to perform well.

EDINBURGH AREA#On Sunday from Sth October to 23rd November, 1969, engineering works on the West Coast main line involved closure of the line between Carstairs and Carlisle and diversion of trains from Glasgow to the south via Kilmarnock. The 11.55 and 12.25 departures from Edinburgh which normally convey through coaches to connect with the Glasgow trains at Carstairs Jct., were cancelled and a special d.m.u. connection provided to Glasgow (Central), departing Edinburgh at 10.50. Matters were complicated on certain of these Sundays by closure of the Midcalder line for roadworks on the outskirts of Edinburgh and on these occasions the connections to and from Edinburgh ran via Polmont, Falkirk (Grahamston) Greenhill (Lower) and Coatbridge.

On 9th November, the 11.05 Birmingham Glasgow/Edinburgh achieved notoriety and a place in the headlines of the local press by arriving at Waverley four hours and eight minutes late. Delay was due in part to the above diversions, to a locomotive failure on the L.M. Region and confusion at Glasgow (Central) over the d.m.u. connection for Edinburgh. Certain East Coast trains were due to be diverted on Sundays from 30th November to 2lst December, 1969 and again on 11th January, 1970 due to replacement of two bridges carrying the railway over the A.1. near Dunbar. Overnight trains on Saturday/Sun day nights from Kings Cross and the 11.00, 12.15 and 13.35 departures to Kings Cross are rerouted to run via Carstairs and Carlisle. Special buses convey Dunbar passengers to join special trains for Newcastle at Berwick.

WAVERLEY#Work commenced during November, 1969 on the construction of a Travel Centre at Edinburgh Waverley due to be completed by July of this year. The main booking hall has been closed off to the public and a temporary enquiry and reservation office set up in the former dining room. Temporary booking offices have been established in wooden huts adjacent to platform 19.

It is to be hoped that the reconstruction will include provision of an improved train arrival indicator as the present chalk board is far from satisfactory, the information on it frequently being completely out-of-date.

A new train to Glasgow leaving at 08.15 on Mondays to Fridays started on 3rd November, thus avoiding the need for seven coaches on the 08.10. A stranger from the Western Region, 1905 (86A), was on the 14.20 to Newcastle on 15th November and 31 (55A) blue was on the 17.12 to Leeds on the 24th.

HAYMARKET#The recently transferred Claytons are now going into service. Recent visitors have included 5187 (D10), 6732 (50B) and 8602 (51L).
