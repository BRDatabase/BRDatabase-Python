Added seaborn (which adds numpy, pandas and matplotlib). This is the package to use for generating graphs of various kinds. See https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html
Added pendulum which is a user friendly datetime library
Added ip2geotools which I am going to use in the middleware to identify what country the request is coming from so I can block bad actors.
